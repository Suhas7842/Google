<p style="font-size:14px;  font-family:'Courier New';"><span style="color: #005A9C;font-weight:bold;"><u>Computer Science Engineering (CSE)</u></span> is an engineering discipline that covers several topics related to computation, programming languages, program design, computer hardware and software and integrates several fields of computer science.Computer Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation, like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.
Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics. In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.</p>
